# Cisco-bits-per-bin-parser

A Visual Basic App Written Years ago (2010 i think) to parse the output of a cisco ADSL router (877) "sh dsl int" 'DMT Bits Per Bin' section into a string that can be pasted into Excel to graph the quality of the connection

### _Example_

Input:  
DMT Bits Per Bin  
000: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 5 5 6 7 7 7  
010: 7 8 8 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 7 6 5 5 4  
020: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
030: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
040: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
050: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
060: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 6 6  
070: 7 7 6 6 0 0 6 0 7 7 0 6 6 7 2 6  
080: 6 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  

Output:  
<#TODO>

## Requires

 .Net 2.0

## Note
There is an easter-egg in the app too! :)  
try and find it before you look in the code, its not well hidden....
